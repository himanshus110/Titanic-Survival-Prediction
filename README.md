# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

The main objective of this Project is to train a model to predict whether a passenger would survive in Titanic or not. It is a good project to start with if you're a beginner to AI/ML.

The dataset has been uploaded in this repository but it can also be found on kaggle.

I have used pandas library to process the data. I have used Matplotplib library to visualize the data to find out patterns and insights that may help in deciding which model to use.

I have used Logistic regression in this project as it's a classification problem.
